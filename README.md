# Usage:
Draw on the map, create a maze, press *Create path* to calculate a path between the start and end point.

# Known bugs/problems:
1. Canvas scale is small, because It is per-pixel based.
2. Default map scale is small, because larger maps doesn't have good preformance.
3. Lots of usage of F# mutable.
